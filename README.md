2. Manager verify client and provides a client id and password to the client.

```
function Reward (client, amount)
  If (amount > $1000)
    client.bonus = 100 * Math.floor(2500 / 1000)
  
Reward ("seafood001", 2500) #=> 200 point
```

- Similar search function also available for gift redemption. E.g. gift with less than 300 points

When client place an order online, the client will choose for delivery or self-pick up at main office.

If the client selected self-pickup, the client has to enter the pick-up time/date.

When an order is made successfully, a confirmation will show the ordered items.

When the client picks up an order, the manager will update the order status as picked-up.

**Client can cancel the order within 24 hours after ordered and at least 24 hours before deliver date.**

**However, the company will charge HKD$50 for the handling fees.**

Manager will login the administration system and handle the daily operations:

1. Maintain details of the item, such name, price, description etc.
2. Update the order status such as process, cancel, delivered, or picked-up.
3. Verify the client identity and provide client id and password.
4. Approve credit amount for client.
5. Obtain a report for incomplete orders.
